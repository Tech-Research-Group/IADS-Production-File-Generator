				<step1>
					<para>Ensure adequate storage space follows specific guidelines as follows:</para>
					<step2>
						<!-- MATERIEL IS THE CORRECT WORD. STOP CHANGING IT -->
						<para>Covered space is preferred. Materiel will be out of the elements and easily controlled.</para>
					</step2>
					<step2>
						<para>Give priority to items that are most susceptible to deterioration from the elements when sufficient covered space is not available.</para>
					</step2>
					<step2>
						<para>Open sites should be improved hardstand, if available.</para>
					</step2>
					<step2>
						<para>Unimproved sites should be firm, well-drained locations that are free of excessive vegetation.</para>
					</step2>
					<step2>
						<para>EPLSM in packed configuration consists of 14 TRICONs (8 ft long x 6-1/2 ft wide x 8 ft tall (2.4 x 2 x 2.4 m) each) capable of three-high stacking. TRICONs can be stored in a single row of 14, 2 stacks of 5 and 1 stack of 4, or any combination between based on available space.</para>
					</step2>
				</step1>
				<step1>
					<para>Ensure adequate maintenance capability during storage as follows:</para>
					<step2>
						<para>Place equipment in storage for limited periods only when a shortage of maintenance capability exists.</para>
					</step2>
					<step2>
						<para>Ensure items are mission ready within 24 hours, or within time factors set by directing authority.</para>
					</step2>
					<step2>
						<para>Keep maintenance records current during storage periods.</para>
