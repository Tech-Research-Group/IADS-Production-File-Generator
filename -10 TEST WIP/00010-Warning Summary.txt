		<title>General Safety Warnings Descriptions</title>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Fire"/>
			<trim.para>All doors and doorways must remain unblocked, both inside and outside, during operation of system to allow for egress during an emergency. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Electrical_Symbols"/>
			<trim.para>High voltage is present during operation. All electrical safety precautions must be followed when operating or maintaining equipment. Failure to comply may result in death or serious injury to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if exposed to electricity.</trim.para>
			<trim.para>All jewelry must be removed before starting work. Metal objects, such as rings or tools, can cause short circuits when contacting live circuits. A direct short can cause instant heating of metal resulting in severe burns. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if exposed to electricity.</trim.para>
			<trim.para>Interior and exterior areas of EPLSM may be a wet environment. Electrical cables and controls should not be handled with wet hands or while standing in water. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Electrical_Symbols"/>
			<trim.para>Generators, power distribution boxes (PDBs), and Expeditionary TRICON System containers must all be grounded to ensure safety of personnel during operation. Operating EPLSM components while ungrounded or improperly grounded may expose personnel to risk of shock resulting in serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
			<trim.para>Source power must be off prior to connecting or removing power cables to any EPLSM equipment.</trim.para>
			<trim.para>Power setup of EPLSM may vary from site to site. When handling circuit breakers (CBs) on PDBs, correct CB can be identified by following power cables from component back to PDB. Failure to observe this warning may result in power remaining at component or being applied to wrong component. This can lead to serious injury or death to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Heavy_Object"/>
			<trim.para>Some items covered in this manual require multiple personnel to lift or move. Appropriate number of personnel must be used when moving large, bulky, or heavy items. Attempting to lift these items with fewer than recommended personnel may cause serious injury. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>

			<icon-set boardno="Heavy_Parts-above"/>
			<icon-set boardno="Ear_Protection_Symbol"/>
			<trim.para>Some items covered in this manual are extremely heavy and require material handling equipment (MHE), or other suitable lifting device, to lift or move. These items should not be attempted to be moved by hand. Personnel must not stand between MHE and item or below item while it is being moved. Serious injury or death to personnel may result in safety precautions are not observed. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
			<trim.para>Hearing can be permanently damaged if personnel are exposed to constant high noise levels of 85 dB or greater. Wear approved hearing protection devices when operating or working within 61 ft (19 m) of MHE when engine is running. Personnel exposed to high noise levels shall participate in a hearing conservation program in accordance with <extref docno="DA PAM 40-501"/>. Hearing loss occurs gradually but becomes permanent over time. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Hot_Area"/>
			<trim.para>Lightheads get extremely hot during operation. Handles should be used to rotate floodlight and flammable material kept at a safe distance. Floodlights must cool for 10-15 minutes before handling. Failure to comply can result in injury to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Hot_Area"/>
			<trim.para>Metal components left in direct sunlight may become too hot to handle. Personnel should wear gloves when handling hot components to prevent burn injury. Run burnt area under cold water and seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Falling"/>
			<trim.para>Cable, hose, and other equipment layout should be accomplished to minimize risk of trip hazards to personnel during operation. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
		</warning>
		<warning>
			<icon-set boardno="Falling"/>
			<trim.para>Setup, packout, and some maintenance require climbing and working at elevated levels. Work on ladder or on top of shelter can result in a fall over 6 ft (1.8 m). Personnel must always maintain a three-point (two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand) contact on steps, position body near middle of step, and face shelter while climbing. A spotter should support base while ladder is occupied. Failure to observe safety precautions may result in injury or death to personnel. Seek immediate medical attention if injury occurs.</trim.para>
