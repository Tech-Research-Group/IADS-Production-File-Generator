		<title>HOW TO OBTAIN TECHNICAL MANUALS</title>
		<para>When a new system is introduced to the Army inventory, it is the responsibility of the receiving units to notify and inform the Unit Publications Clerk that a Technical Manual (TM) is available for the new system. Throughout the life cycle of the new system, the Publications Proponent will also provide updates and changes to the TM.</para>
		<para>To receive new TMs or change packages to fielded TMs, provide the Unit Publications Clerk the full TM number, title, date of publication, and number of copies required. The Unit Publications Clerk will justify the request through the Unit Publications Officer. When the request is approved, <extref docno="DA Form 12"/> is used to order the series of TMs from the Army Publishing Directorate (APD).</para>

		<title>ORGANIZATION OF THIS MANUAL</title>
		<para>This TM has been organized using the WP concept. Each chapter contains a series of WPs rather than sections and paragraphs. Each WP is designed to stand alone as a complete information module. Each WP is numbered using a four-digit number beginning with WP 0001. WPs are numbered sequentially throughout the TM (e.g., WP 0001, WP 0002, etc.).</para>
		<para>The WP number is located at the top right of each page. It is also located at the bottom of the page with the WP page number included (0001-1 would be page 1 of the General Information WP). Each WP starts on a right-hand page. This is done so a single WP can be removed from the paper TM if needed for a task. Blank pages are inserted as needed to ensure an even number of pages for each WP. Blank pages are assigned a number, but it does not appear in the TM. For example, if page 0001-10 of a WP is blank, page 0001-9 will have the number 0001-9/blank; or if page 0001-1 of a WP is blank, page 0001-2 will have the number 0001-blank/2.</para>
		<para>Multiple work packages may be required to complete a maintenance action. References are used to avoid repeating information. Referenced work packages can be found in each WP's Initial Setup information.</para>
		<para>Each task within a maintenance or troubleshooting WP contains step-by-step procedures and will end with the words END OF TASK, and each WP ends with the statement END OF WORK PACKAGE.</para>
		<subpara1>
			<title>WARNINGs, CAUTIONs, and NOTEs</title>
			<para>Warning, caution, and note headings, chapter titles, and paragraph headings are printed in bold type. Warning icons may be included below the warning heading. Multiple warning, caution, or note paragraphs, if necessary, will appear below one warning, caution, or note heading. Prior to starting a WP, all warnings included in the WP should be reviewed, understood, and followed. Review the materials/parts in the initial setup of the WP for any hazardous materials used during maintenance of the equipment. Then refer to the detailed warnings for hazardous materials in the Warning Summary. Make sure to read all warnings within referenced WP that are required to complete tasks.</para>
